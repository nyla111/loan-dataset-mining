Loan Default Prediction - Machine Learning Project
📊 Overview
A comprehensive data science project demonstrating the full machine learning lifecycle for predicting loan defaults. The project consists of two sequential assignments: data exploration/preprocessing followed by predictive modeling.

What I Built
Assignment 2: Complete exploratory data analysis and preprocessing pipeline for a loan dataset

Assignment 3: Multi-model classification system for predicting loan default risk with Kaggle competition submission

Technical Skills
Languages: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Data Engineering: Data cleaning, feature engineering, missing value handling, outlier detection

Machine Learning: Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN, SVM, Neural Networks

Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, Cross-validation

Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Kaggle Platform

Key Features
End-to-End Workflow: From raw data exploration to production-ready predictions

Multi-Model Comparison: Systematic evaluation of 5+ classification algorithms

Imbalance Handling: Specialized techniques for skewed financial data

Professional Pipeline: Modular, reproducible code with clear documentation

Outcomes
Demonstrated complete CRISP-DM workflow implementation

Built predictive models for financial risk assessment

Participated in Kaggle competition with formatted submissions

Showcased ability to handle real-world, imbalanced datasets
